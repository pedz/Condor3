I implemented a way to roll the database back to a particular state
via restore.  I tried using templates but the restore proved faster.
You can see this in features/support/database_state.rb and
features/support/snapshot_hook.rb

These files are various pieces of that work.  Mostly they are tools
to create the template-smaller.db database.  Unfortunately, at this
point, I don't remember how to work them.
