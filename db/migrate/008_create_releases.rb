# Its unfortunate but "release" has two meanings.  I believe
# everywhere in Condor, "release" will be a cmvc release and not a
# release such as "5.2", etc.
# From the ptfapardef records a release will always point to a family
# (although of questionable value).  To get the link from the
# ptfapardef records to the pc_view records, a release will also point
# to a version.  The version will be the ending substring of the
# release.  Currently all versions we care about are exactly three
# characters.
