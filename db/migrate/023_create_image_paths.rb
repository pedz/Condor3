# An image path is somewhat completely concocted but I keep them to
# help figure out which image paths I have not ransacked yet.
#
# I'm going to build on top of this arbitrariness by adding a
# non-package package.  All flat files that the scan mounts script
# comes accross will add an entry in to the image paths.  If the image
# really is a package then a real package record will be entered and
# used.  Otherwise, the image will point to the non-package package.
