# Essentially these maps are produced from the pc_view input.  The
# exception is when a ptfapardef record specifies something that has
# not yet been seen in a pc_view record.
#
# While the pc_view has other data, it does not seem to be of use.
# In particular, the un-listed PTF field is not used.  In the pc_view
# it is just a PTF and there is not a release nor a fileset in the
# pc_view.  Subsequent calls to rp2 could be made to flush out the
# information but the belief is that eventually (perhaps even at the
# same time) the same information will be present in a ptfapardef
# record and the form in that record is far easier to work with.
