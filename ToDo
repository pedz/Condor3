Add APAR draft route and
  finish triangle things on swinfo page.
Help text for these presenters:
    cmvc_defect_change_presenter
    cmvc_defect_text_line_presenter
    file_change_presenter
    swinfo_presenter
    which_fileset_presenter
No hits for swinfo is confusing.

Need better db restore
Per User Configuration
Set up staging server
Figure out multi server deploy
Add rspecs for json requests as well as error paths
Add cucumber features to completely describe the interface... probably
  need to include json requests too.
Change the various "diffs" calls to supply the previous version so it
  does not have to be retrieved from CMVC.
